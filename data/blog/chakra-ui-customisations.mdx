## Customisations with Chakra-ui

Chakra-ui has come a long way. Since their `V1` release and they have been adding features and making the library more and more complete. With `V1.5` You can surely depend on `Chakra-UI` to build high quality, very pleasing and accessible modern apps. 

Customisations are a big part of any component library. After all, each prodcut has its own colors and its own brand. A good component library makes using the brand colors and conveying the design intent easy to write and easy to maintain. Not only does`Chakra-UI` ship with great theme, it also gives you the tools to customise that theme to your liking all you want. 

## Adding colors

Adding brand colors is very simple. Withe the new utility function `extendTheme` you can easily add and customise more than colors to your theme. For now let's pay attention to adding colors to our theme. 

The idea is the return of the function is a new theme variably that you pass in the `ChakraProvider` at the core of your app. The new theme will have the original theme from Chakra-UI and whatever you have added on. Let's suppose we have those brand colors we want to add to our theme. Those colors are adopted from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23845EC2&sub=1) with a simple flare on a favoritr purple colour. 

- Primary: `#845EC2`
- Secondary : `#FF6F91`
- Highlight: `#00C9A7`
- Warning: `#FFC75F`
- Danger: `#C34A36`

Let's take a look and see how we can easily add those colors to our theme. 

```jsx{8,9,10,11,12}
// 1. Import the function `extendTheme`
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

// 2. Call `extendTheme` and pass your custom values
const myNewTheme = extendTheme({
  // Whatever you pass here will be added to the colors not replace it
  colors: { 
    primary: "#845EC2",
    secondary: "#FF6F91",
    highlight: "#00C9A7",
    warning: "#FFC75F",
    danger: "#C34A36",
  },
})

// 3. Pass the new theme to `ChakraProvider` -> This happens at the core of your 
// your app. `_app.tsx` for a nextJS app
<ChakraProvider theme={myNewTheme}>
  <App />
</ChakraProvider>

// 4. Now you can use these colors in your components
function MyCustomBox() {
  return <Box bg="primary">Welcome</Box>
}
```

## Customising components

Well, what's the use of cutsom colors if you can use them to color up your buttons eh! Chakra-ui allows to add custom variants for all the built in components. A feature that is so handy and allows you to avoid so much messy complicated ways to build new components from scratch. Trust me, I've been there ðŸ˜…

Chakra-ui gives us a basic object style structure we can use to customize the components, add variants and do much more. We simply declare a object that follows the following structure:

```javascript
export const ButtonStyles = {
  // style object for base or default style
  baseStyle: {},
  // styles for different sizes ("sm", "md", "lg")
  sizes: {},
  // styles for different visual variants ("outline", "solid")
  variants: {},
  // default values for `size` and `variant`
  defaultProps: {},
};

```

Then we need to add the `ButtonStyles` into our `extendTheme` function to add it to our theme. 

```javascript
// Notice the import as cus we need to pass this as Button into the function
import { ButtonStyles as Button } from "./ButtonStyles";

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: "#845EC2",
    secondary: "#FF6F91",
    highlight: "#00C9A7",
    warning: "#FFC75F",
    danger: "#C34A36",
  },
  components: {
    Button, // Has to match to the name of the component
  },
});
```

Now this is exactly how Chakr-ui team builds their components. If you're wondering how? Easy, Chakra-ui files can be seen [here](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/packages/theme/src/components). You can find the core Button styles [here](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/main/packages/theme/src/components/button.ts). Definitly worth a read through if we are keen to do any advanced work on components. 

Now let's say we need to add a `primary` variant to our buttons. We can easily do that by adding the following to our variants object:

```javascript
import { darken, mode, whiten } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools";

// Inide of `ButtonStyles`
	variants: {
    primary: (props) => ({
      bg: "primary", // Notice the use of color directly here
      color: "white",
      _hover: {
        // Notice the use of `mode` function to change color 
        // based on theme color mode
        bg: mode(whiten("primary", 20), darken("primary", 20))(props),
        boxShadow: "md",
      },
    }),
  },
```

The `primary` variant could also have been a simpler object. Not changing values based on the color mode. As follows:

```javascript
import { darken, mode, whiten } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools";

// Inide of `ButtonStyles`
	variants: {
    // Notice the far simpler structure
    primary: {
      bg: "primary",
      color: "white",
      _hover: {
        bg: 'secondary',
        boxShadow: "md",
      },
    },
  },
```

So you can use both ways. You can either supply the object styles directly or pass a function that will return them. Very handy! ðŸ”¥

Same thing can be done for more and more customisations:

```javascript
import { darken, mode, whiten } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools";

	variants: {
    primary: (props) => ({
      bg: "primary",
      color: "white",
      _hover: {
        bg: mode(whiten("primary", 20), darken("primary", 20))(props),
        boxShadow: "md",
      },
    }),
    secondary: (props) => ({
      bg: "secondary",
      color: "white",
      _hover: {
        bg: mode(whiten("secondary", 20), darken("secondary", 20))(props),
        boxShadow: "md",
      },
    }),
    secondaryOutline: (props) => ({
      bg: "transparent",
      border: "1px solid",
      borderColor: "secondary",
      color: "secondary",
      transition: "all 200ms ease",
      _hover: {
        boxShadow: "md",
        transform: "scale(1.02)",
      },
    }),
  },
```
